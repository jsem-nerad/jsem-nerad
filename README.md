## Hi there! 👋

I'm Vojtěch, a 15-year-old Python developer, electronics tinkerer, and math enthusiast from the Czech Republic 🇨🇿.

🔧 I love:
- Writing clean and creative Python code
- Building Raspberry Pi projects (check out [raspi-fm](https://github.com/jsem-nerad/raspi-fm))
- Designing modern front-end interfaces
- Managing Linux backends and servers
- Visualizing mathematics and graph functions
- Fixing and reverse-engineering electronics

🎓 I’ve been programming in Python for 6 years, and I’ve placed 2nd twice in the [ČVUT Robosoutěž](https://robosoutez.fel.cvut.cz/).

🖥️ I run my own local servers, use Linux daily, and I'm an active member of my school’s EcoTeam 🌱.
